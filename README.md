# Project: Selenium Automation Bot - Cookie Clicker Game (Automation)

Demo video: https://youtu.be/4d8M_fI_xVA

Description: Using Selenium, an automated bot plays an online game (cookie clicker) and attempts to amass as many "cookies/second" as it can within a 5 minute time limit

Python Libraries: Selenium

# How to use:

Make sure that you have chromedriver.exe installed to the "C:\Development" directory. The chromedriver version must be compatible with your current Google Chrome version

If you'd like to use a different directory, that should be fine if you update cookie_clicker.py line 15 to reflect that. It must be a separate directory from the one in which cookie_clicker.py is stored

From there, run cookie_clicker.py and a new window will open. The bot will immediately do its thing for the preset time (5 minutes, set on line 27. This can be adjusted as desired)
